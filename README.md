CMS Tree Status
=================
Adds styles to the cms page tree to clearly identify pages in draft mode, changed on draft, or removed from draft/live. The idea of this module came from [silverstripe/silverstripe-framework#2794](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/pull/2794) so it can serve as a temporary solution till the UI is adjusted in what will likely be 3.2.
